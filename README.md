# fluxnode
Fluxnodes are the hardware side of my lighting system

Designed to be built from mostly off-the-shelf components, this guide includes parts lists for the purchaseable components, 3D models to print the specialised parts, and PCB files for the custom 'motherboard'. Build instructions also provided.

The system is designed around a Raspberry Pi & Fadecandy combo, but could be adapted to use other 1-8+ channel WS2811 LED driving solutions.

v3 of the system is intended to work with the ESP32 - WIP :)

## v1 - Fluxnode

Internal mains (240V/120V etc.) to 5V power supply (150W).
AND/OR
Internal 12/24V DC -> 5V DC power supply (150W).

8x LED outputs.

## v2 - Mini Fluxnode
