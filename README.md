# fluxnode
Fluxnodes are the hardware side of my lighting system

Designed to be built from mostly off-the-shelf components, this guide includes parts lists for the purchaseable components, 3D models to print the specialised parts, and PCB files for the custom 'motherboard'. Build instructions also provided.

Essentially this is an elaborate way to waterproof and ruggedise a Raspberry Pi & [Fadecandy](https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy) combo (along with power supply), but can be adapted to use other 1-8+ channel WS2811 LED driving solutions. Fadecandy is kind of obsolete these days sadly.

v3 of the system is intended to work with the ESP32 - WIP :)
